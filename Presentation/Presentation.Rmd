# MAKING AN IMPACT

# Motivation

- Develop a model for return impact position

- The typical spatial characteristics of the return impact position of top men's players

- How are the serve number, serve direction, surface type influence their position?

- ATP lefties in the top 100 rankings' return impact

---
# What is the return impact?

.pull-left[ 

- **Serve Return** is the receiver hits off of their opponent's serve.

- **Return Impact** position is when the receiving player makes contact with the ball on the serve return

- **2018-2020**

- **84** players    

-  **25** variables 

- **126,455** observations

???
- The data is summary tracking data total **1,287** matches and **84** players from **2018-2020** for the Men's Pro Tennis Tournament. 
- There are **25** variables and **126,455** observations in this data set and each observation refers to a single point within a match.

# Exploration of the Data

# Model Discovery
### What is the Gaussian Mixture Model

$$f(x_i) = \sum_{k=1}^G\pi_kf_k(x_i; \mu_k, \Sigma_k)$$
where $f_k$ is usually a multivariate normal distribution. The parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood, and choice between models is made using BIC.

$$BIC = −2L(\hat{\theta}) + ν ln n$$

# Find the result

- The typical spatial characteristics of the return impact position of top men's players
- ATP lefties in the top 100 rankings' return impact
- How are the serve number, serve direction, surface type influence their position?

### The typical spatial characteristics of the return impact position of top 5 men's players

- N. Djokovic, R. Federer, D. Thiem, D. Schwartzman, R. Nadal
